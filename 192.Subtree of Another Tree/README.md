For each node in a tree, we can create node.merkle, a hash representing it's subtree.
This hash is formed by hashing the concatenation of the merkle of the left child, the node's value, and the merkle of the right child. Then, two trees are identical if and only if the merkle hash of their roots are equal (except when there is a hash collision.) From there, finding the answer is straightforward: we simply check if any node in s has node.merkle == t.merkle
